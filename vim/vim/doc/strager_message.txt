  mt19937 is not available in this version

You are using mt19937, which requires the |+num64| feature. The |+num64|
feature is not compiled, so mt19937 will not work.

							*ES003*  >
  Invalid seed type, expected list or number

You are giving an unsupported object as a seed to
|strager#random_mt19937#make_generator|, such as a |Dictionary|. Give an
integer or a list of integers instead.
